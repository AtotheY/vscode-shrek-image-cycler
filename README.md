# Image Cycler

This is a meme vscode extension that essentially cycles through a pre-set list of images and force-opens them on your vscode. Yes it's useless, but it's fun. Made for a YT video.

Use Cmd+P and type `>Image cycler` to find the settings of the extension. You can start/stop the image rotation there.
